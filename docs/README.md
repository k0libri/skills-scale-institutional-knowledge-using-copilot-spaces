# OctoAcme — Project Management Overview

OctoAcme follows a lightweight, iterative project lifecycle that moves work through Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close/Retrospective. Initiation captures the problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and a high‑level timeline in a Project One‑pager. Planning turns that approval into a prioritized backlog with clear acceptance criteria, estimates, a Definition of Done, dependency mapping and a release/milestone plan. The process emphasizes timeboxed kickoffs, capacity‑aware pulls from the backlog, and an actively maintained Risk Register that is reviewed regularly.

Day‑to‑day execution uses a visible project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a disciplined pull request flow: small PRs, issue links and acceptance criteria in PR descriptions, automated tests and security scans in CI, and required approvals before merging. Team rhythm includes daily standups, regular delivery syncs, sprint demos/reviews, and PM+PdM alignment meetings. Progress, decisions, and release notes are kept in a single source of truth in the project repo.

Roles and responsibilities are explicit so ownership and communication are clear: Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog; Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communications; Developers implement features, tests, and docs; QA validates acceptance criteria and runs manual checks when needed. Stakeholders receive weekly or milestone updates and escalation paths are defined from team triage up to sponsors, with a separate security incident runbook for urgent events.

Quality is embedded throughout the lifecycle: unit and integration tests, CI security scanning, and end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows are required before release. Releases follow a checklist‑driven approach (pre‑release checks, staging smoke tests, automated pipelines, post‑deploy verifications and documented rollback/playbooks). Retrospectives after sprints or incidents produce a small number of tracked action items that are added back into the backlog to drive continuous improvement.
